
# Beginner Projects 
- [ ] Binary Classifications with EBMs
      - Train an EBM as a binary classifier on MNIST.
      - Compare it with logistic regression or neural networks.
      - Experiment with different energy functions.
- [ ] Denoising with EBMs
      - Train an EBM for image denoising.
      - Add noise to MNIST/CIFAR-10 images and train the model to reconstruct the clean image.
      - Compare with traditional denoising autoencoders.
