- [ ] EBM for Anomaly Detection <br/> 
      - Train an EBM on normal samples (e.g., normal digits from MNIST).<br/> 
      - Use the modelâ€™s energy function to detect anomalies (e.g., out-of-distribution images).<br/> 
      - Compare with autoencoder-based anomaly detection.<br/> 

# Intermediate Projects
